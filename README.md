## About My Website
 For a friend's burgeoning landscaping business, I designed and developed the LT Lawn Care website, a digital storefront that embodies the green thumb and commitment to quality that the business stands for. Utilizing my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, I crafted a responsive website that adapts gracefully to any device, ensuring that potential customers experience the same level of care and attention online as they would in their own yards.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design:** A flexible layout that guarantees an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Interactive User Interface:** With JavaScript at the helm, the site offers interactive elements that engage users and enhance navigability.
- **Aesthetic Visuals:** CSS stylings provide a lush and inviting appearance, reflecting the high-quality service of the LT Lawn Care brand.
- **Custom Graphics & Photos:** Integration of a curated photo gallery showcasing the company’s past projects and the beauty of their workmanship.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** A user-friendly interface that allows visitors to easily explore services, view the photo gallery, and contact the business.
